# Simulated-CPU
This project was coded in C and it included the construction of a data structure that mimicked a CPU. The data structure had 16 "registers" and a program counter. It's main function was to take in an argument in the form of an ARM Assembly command, and perform the appropriate processes on the 16 registers.
